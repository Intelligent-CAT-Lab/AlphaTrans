## Graal-based Semantic Check
Execute the following from the root directory of the project to run the Graal-based semantic check.
```bash
python src/compositional_glue_tests/semantic_check.py --project <project_name> [--class=<class_name>] [--method=<method_name>]
```

> [!NOTE]
> GraalVM must be installed on the system and the default Java path must be set to GraalVM's installation directory.

If a `pom.xml` does not already exist for the project, the script will copy the original `pom.xml` to the project directory and throw an exception. You are required to manually check that the Java version in the `pom.xml` is set to at least 8 and that GraalVM is included in the dependencies. Once this is done, you can run the script again.
