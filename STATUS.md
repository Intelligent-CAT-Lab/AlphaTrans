### Badges
* We claim the _Artifacts Available_ badge as we made our artifacts publicly available on Github and Zenodo.

* We claim the _Artifacts Evaluated - Functional_ badge as our artifacts are documented, consistent, complete, exercisable, and include appropriate evidence of verification and validation.

* We claim the _Artifacts Evaluated - Reusable_ badge as our artifacts are carefully documented and well-structured. Moreover, our tool is reusable and has already been used in the software engineering community. Please see [this](https://github.com/Intelligent-CAT-Lab/AlphaTrans/issues/2#issuecomment-2625586985).
